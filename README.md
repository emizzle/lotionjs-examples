# Lotion.js examples

There are two example applications in this repo:
1. [Basic wallet](./examples/basic-wallet/README.md) - An example of an application chain that creates a coin with balances using `coin` middleware for LotionJS. The wallet allows transfer of coin value between addresses.
2. [SimpleStorage](./examples/simple-storage/README.md) - example of how a simple smart contract could be created. The `client` creates a very minimal CLI for interacting with the smart contract. The client can be run on as many different clients as needed and the state will be replicated automatically.
